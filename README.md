# K9MatchMaker

Origin
The idea comes from a dog owner who is desperately looking for a playmate with the same interest and personality as her dog. After observing dogs for years, she realized there are few different types of dogs.

- dogs who like to wrestle
- dogs who like to chase and/or be chased
- dogs who like to chill and play with other delicate dogs
- dogs who only like to play with dogs that are smaller than them

Keeping your dog healthy and well-behaved makes for a happy pet owner
There is an old saying that couldn't be truer: "A tired dog is a good dog" 

Just like with people, when dogs receive a healthy balance of physical and mental stimulation, they will be happy and well-adjusted. Your dog wakes up each morning with a certain amount of physical and mental energy that he or she needs to expend to feel happy, occupied, and balanced. What your dog needs will be different from other dogs;  breed, age, size, and individual temperament all contribute to this, as does your dog's mood on any given day. 

Dogs that don't receive adequate stimulation for their bodies and their brains might be restless, destructive, hard to train, and even in the worst cases, aggressive and irritable (just like people!)”

DOGWATCH is designed to connect your fur baby with a fur friend that has the same interest to make sure that you and your baby have receive the most fulfilling playdates. The saying “A TIRED DOG IS A HAPPY DOG” could not be truer!!
